## Repository - Files Description

There are two main folders and one .pdf file:
	- presentation.pdf, is our final presentation file.
	- group_5_project, contains all the code relevant to run our simulation project:
		- we have a unique notebook, as requested, able to reproduce all results.
		- at the same time, we have multiple .py files, as we found more convenient to work with vanilla python files when working in a team. Moreover, in this way, the code is cleaner, more modular, and more readable.
	- labs, this folder contains our final labs submission. For each lab, we have submitted an unique notebook. The folder is further suddivided in:
		- labs_simulation, which contains all simulation notebooks.
		- labs_optimization, which contains all optimization notebooks.
